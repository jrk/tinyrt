 \defgroup TRTConcepts TinyRT Concepts
 \brief A group of classes which define the interfaces used in TinyRT templates.

 TRT, by convention, uses a system of "concepts".  These are similar in spirit to the concept construct that
is defined by C++0x, but since 0x support is not yet widespread, TRT approaches concepts using well defined conventions.

All template type names in TRT template definitions will be of the form:  Name_T.  Here, "Name" will be the name of the concept
to which corresponding types in the template instantiations must adhere.  Any type used to instantiate a template MUST adhere 
to the corresponding concept type in order to ensure correct behavior.

Concepts are documented in the TRTConcepts.h file, which defines a set of concept definition classes.  These classes are 
named with the convention "Type_C", where "Type" is again the name of the associated concept.  The _C classes are not used 
anywhere in the TRT codebase, and are not meant to be used by library clients.  These class definitions serve only to document the
requirements for the types used in TRT templates.

The collection of types, typedefs, and methods in a TRT concept class will be referred to as a "concept signature".  Any type 
adhering to a concept must provide methods or types which match those in the signature.


Any member classes in concept signatures should be thought of as "inlined" concept definitions.  They specify that
adhering types must have a member type with the specified name, which adheres to the concept signature of the member class.

Typedefs in concept signatures specify that an adhering class must have a type with the specified name, which adheres to
another concept.  


Where appropriate, inheritance may be used in concept definitions.  When inheritance is present, any types adhering to a
"derived" concept are required to also adhere to all of its "base" concepts.

Note that in order for a templatized code to do anything useful, there must generally be BEHAVIORAL constraints
 assigned to the concept methods, beyond their simple signatures.  There is no way to express these
  constraints syntactically, so they are described in english comments, which should be considered part of the concept signature.

Any types which are intended to adhere to a TRT concept must exhibit the specified behavior for each method in the 
concept signature.
